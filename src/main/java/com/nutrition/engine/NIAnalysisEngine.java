/**
 * Created by jonathan on 19/03/17.
 *
 * A rudamentary analysis machine that can predict and array of  nutritional
 * esitimations, provide real-time-critical feedback, throw red-green-amber flags
 * on food intake and generally be a functioning operative brain on all things
 * ingestible in the users food history.
 *
 * To begin with, this data analysis will follow a simple measure of
 * input output: based on food 'z' you ate x nutrient. due to time passing 't'
 * and exercise amount 'e', this has passed, and you should are recommended intake
 * for this, which can be found in foods abc..
 *
 * Further thought effort is required to investigate a turnover from passible and rudimentary
 * to a service worth paying for.
 *
 * Possible future evolutionary iterations may include machine-learning algorithms and
 * a interface into data-transmission between a client and nanobot implanted in the human data server,
 * providing seamless reading of any and every possible corner of the human nutrtition spectrum,
